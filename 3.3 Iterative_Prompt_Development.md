# Iterative Prompt Development
When we are writing prompts to develop an application using LLM, the process can be quite similar
where we have an idea for what we want to do, the task we want to complete, and we can then take a
first attempt at writing a prompt that hopefully is clear and specific, and maybe, if appropriate,
gives the system time to think. And then we can run it and see what result we get. And if it doesn't
work well enough the first time, then the iterative process of figuring out why the instructions,
for example, were not clear enough or why it didn’t give the algorithm enough time to think, allows
us to refine the idea, refine the prompt and so on, and to go around this loop multiple times until
we end up with a prompt that works for our application.

```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```
```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

Let's try to generate a marketing product description from a product fact sheet

This was our first attempt in writing a prompt to the model but the response in quite long. Maybe we want it to be a little bit shorter. SO here we will clarify the prompt by adding a line, **`"Use atmost 50 words."`**.

This actually looks much nice and short description. Let's check the length of the response.
```python
len(response.split())
OUTPUT --> 49

LLMs are not that great at following instructions about precise word count. But this is actually not bad. Sometimes it will print out something with 60 or 65 so on words, but it's kind of within reason. Some of the things we could try to do would be to say "use atmost three sentences" or "use atmost 280 characters".<br>
Let's take the prompt and change it such that we want more precise abouth the technical details about the furniture.

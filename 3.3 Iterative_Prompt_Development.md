# Iterative Prompt Development
When we are writing prompts to develop an application using LLM, the process can be quite similar
where we have an idea for what we want to do, the task we want to complete, and we can then take a
first attempt at writing a prompt that hopefully is clear and specific, and maybe, if appropriate,
gives the system time to think. And then we can run it and see what result we get. And if it doesn't
work well enough the first time, then the iterative process of figuring out why the instructions,
for example, were not clear enough or why it didn’t give the algorithm enough time to think, allows
us to refine the idea, refine the prompt and so on, and to go around this loop multiple times until
we end up with a prompt that works for our application.

```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```
```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

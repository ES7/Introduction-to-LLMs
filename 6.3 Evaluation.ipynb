There are various ways to evaluate like Training Curves (rank_loss, reward, kl_loss), Automation Metrics (Micro-F1, Macro-F1, ROUGE-L, BLEU) and Side by Side Evaluation. For RLHF the training curves and side-by-side evaluation have been most useful."

Here's my situation:\\n\\nAbout 10 years ago as I was traveling, I applied for my first credit card which was an AMEX delta card. For the years after, I traveled often, and got benefits from this card.\\n\\nNow, after I have recently graduated college, and landed a full time job, I no longer have time to travel as much, and therefore have no need to use the Delta card. Last year I paid off my balance with the card, and haven't used it since.\\n\\nRecently, I had to pay the $95 annual fee, and realized that I should perhaps consider another credit card. I thought about closing this account and applying for a cash rewards card.\\n\\nNow my issue is that this is my ONLY and OLDEST credit card account. I would like to close the account and apply for a Bank of America cash rewards card as my checking/savings accounts are with them. However, I am concerned with how this will affect my credit report.\\n\\nWill closing this account greatly affect my credit score?\\n\\nI even spoke with the reps at AMEX about downgrading to a cash rewards card with no annual fee, and apparently I cannot do this as my AMEX card is linked with the Delta account. I do not want this card, I'm stuck in a pickle...\\n\\nAny advice would be appreciated! [summary]:</td>\n",

That's why I thought I try something different. I have good skills in photoshop, indesign and illustrator. As a teenager I also built websites using HTML, so I thought I build a dummy website fitted to their company and attach some screenshots to my application.\\n\\nWhat do you think? I this a feasible idea or will they be offended?\\n\\nThank you very much in advance. [summary]:    \n",

Here's my situation:\\n\\nAbout 10 years ago as I was traveling, I applied for my first credit card which was an AMEX delta card. For the years after, I traveled often, and got benefits from this card.\\n\\nNow, after I have recently graduated college, and landed a full time job, I no longer have time to travel as much, and therefore have no need to use the Delta card. Last year I paid off my balance with the card, and haven't used it since.\\n\\nRecently, I had to pay the $95 annual fee, and realized that I should perhaps consider another credit card. I thought about closing this account and applying for a cash rewards card.\\n\\nNow my issue is that this is my ONLY and OLDEST credit card account. I would like to close the account and apply for a Bank of America cash rewards card as my checking/savings accounts are with them. However, I am concerned with how this will affect my credit report.\\n\\nWill closing this account greatly affect my credit score?\\n\\nI even spoke with the reps at AMEX about downgrading to a cash rewards card with no annual fee, and apparently I cannot do this as my AMEX card is linked with the Delta account. I do not want this card, I'm stuck in a pickle...\\n\\nAny advice would be appreciated! [summary]:    \n",

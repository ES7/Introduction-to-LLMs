    "# Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Language Models (LLMs) are designed to respond to prompts, representing a novel method of programming computers. Crafting effective prompts is both an art and a science, aimed at optimizing a model's performance for specific tasks. By presenting LLMs with structured prompts resembling complete documents, we can leverage their ability to generate responses tailored to our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interacting with LLMs is straightforward through their websites like ChatGPT, Bard, etc., although these platforms have limitations. A more versatile approach involves programmatically interacting with LLMs using languages like Python, JavaScript, etc. This method unlocks a new paradigm in software development, enabling the creation of AI applications through prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the use case of creating an automatic grader for a high school history class. Traditionally, developers would need to devise logic to handle various answer variations, possibly requiring a list of all potential correct answers and employing exact or fuzzy string matching algorithms. In the new paradigm, developers can offload the logic to the LLM through prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective prompt engineering involves several key strategies. First, prompts should be descriptive and provide examples to guide the LLM's response. Structured text can help organize the prompt's content, while a chain of thoughts can lead the LLM to generate more coherent responses. Assigning a chatbot persona to the LLM, such as a role or expertise, can further enhance its responses. Another approach is to let the LLM ask questions, allowing developers to extract information and generate more comprehensive responses. Finally, developers should regularly review and refine past interactions to improve the LLM's performance over time."

# Principles for Prompting

### Setup
Load the API key and relevant Python libraries.
```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```
Here we are using OpenAI's **`gpt-3.5-turbo`** model and the [chat completions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat).
```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```
**NOTE:** If you are using OpenAI library version **`0.27.0`**, then replace the line of code 
**`response = client.chat.completions.create()`** with **`response = openai.ChatCompletion.create()`**.

- **First Principle :-** Write clear and specific instructions.<br>
- **Second Principle :-** Give the model time to "think".<br>
We should express what we want the model to do by providing instructions that are as clear and specific as we can possibly make them.
This will guide the model towards the desired output and reduce the chance that we get irrelevant or incorrect responses.
Don't confuse writing a clear prompt with writing a short prompt, because in many cases, longer prompts actually provide more clarity
and context for the model, which can actually lead to more detailed and relevant outputs.

### Tactics
**Tactic 1:** To help us write clear and specific instructions, use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input.
Like (""", ```, â€”, < >, <tag> </tag>).
```python
text = f"""

"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

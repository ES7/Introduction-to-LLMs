    "If a model is making reasoning errors by rushing to an incorrect conclusion, we should try reframing the query to request a chain or series of relevant reasoning before the model provides its final answer. Another way to think about this is that if we give a model a task that is too complex for it to do in a short amount of time or in a small number of words, it may make up a guess which is likely to be incorrect. And we know this would happen for a person too. If we ask someone to complete a complex math quesion without time to work out the answer first, they would also likely make a mistake.
